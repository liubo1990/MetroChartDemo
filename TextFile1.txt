1. change namespace - remember to back up everything really well  beforehand.
	There is a file called XAMLReplaceTargets which has caused issues when I do a copy and replace
	I think that is what is causing all the issues with my other version not working
	Does there need to be information about this file put somewhere?
2. Main Key is some sort of signing key - is it mine now? Can I / should I remove it?
	Yes, if its not mine
3. Try puttiing this into another application and write information on how to do it


SCATTER CHART TO DO
1. Issue with points on 0 and maximum - have to increase size of columns by 1/2 width of scatter
and change the height accordingly
2. Colour and style of bullets - style name in the series?
3. Enable the numbers to be turned off
4. legend
5.do I want to draw the same way as the multi-chart? - I think it would be best


Will have two charts - GAScatterLineChart and GAColumnScatterLineChart

** have a multiTypeSeries where you can set the type to be line, bullet, or both
** this is how the scatter chart should work instead of the current scatter
** but this shows I can do IT!

** ** create .cs file in the code, and a link to it in  the librarby
** ** update the xaml in the code and it will get copied to the library
** ** can style the charts in the test app Graohs.xaml
** ** put custom bullet and line styles in Graohs.xaml BUT leave the std GA ones alone


setup notes
If using the solution and not the .dll only (not sure if you can do this?) then add
reference to the wpf one

Alter the Generic.xaml in the MetroChart (with the code) and the other one gets updated
Always copy link to .WPF folder too
