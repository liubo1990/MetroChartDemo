1. change namespace - remember to back up everything really well  beforehand.
	There is a file called XAMLReplaceTargets which has caused issues when I do a copy and replace
	I think that is what is causing all the issues with my other version not working
	Does there need to be information about this file put somewhere?
2. Main Key is some sort of signing key - is it mine now? Can I / should I remove it?
	Yes, if its not mine
3. Try puttiing this into another application and write information on how to do it



setup notes
If using the solution and not the .dll only (not sure if you can do this?) then add
reference to the wpf one
