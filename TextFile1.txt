2. Main Key is some sort of signing key - is it mine now? Can I / should I remove it?
	Yes, if its not mine
3. Try puttiing this into another application and write information on how to do it





Notes for documentataieon

Only mouse event at the moment is mouse over for tooltips
mouse over doesnt work byu default for line chart, but can fake it by having a 'both' chart with transparent bullet.
Done like this so that complex, or many poinmt charts dont have to have tooltips
No axis markings on horizontal axis for same reason (many points in small space make it messy) May look at max, min values later




SCATTER CHART TO DO

 1.5 - background of plot area (canvas) could be coloured
 1.6 - what other values should be coloured that previous version can? ie what binding or testing




this is how the other pieces are bound - do I need to do something similar?
it gets the data from the datapoint into the scatterPiece
<local:GAScatterPiece
                                    Background="{Binding Path=ItemBrush}"  
                                    SelectedBrush="{Binding Path=SelectedBrush}"  
                                    Percentage="{Binding Path=PercentageFromMaxDataPointValue}"                                                                                                 
                                    IsClickedByUser="{Binding Path=IsClickedByUser, Mode=TwoWay}"
                                    IsSelected="{Binding Path=IsSelected}"
                                    ClientWidth="{Binding Path=RealWidth, ElementName=itemsControl}"
                                    ClientHeight="{Binding Path=RealHeight, ElementName=itemsControl}"
                                    >



Will have two charts - GAScatterLineChart and GAColumnScatterLineChart

** have a multiTypeSeries where you can set the type to be line, bullet, or both
** this is how the scatter chart should work instead of the current scatter
** but this shows I can do IT!

** ** create .cs file in the code, and a link to it in  the librarby
** ** update the xaml in the code and it will get copied to the library
** ** can style the charts in the test app Graohs.xaml
** ** put custom bullet and line styles in Graohs.xaml BUT leave the std GA ones alone
